# Java Basic 10 Programs

Welcome to the Java Basic 10 Programs repository! This repository contains a collection of fundamental Java programs designed to help you understand essential programming concepts and enhance your coding skills.

## Description

This repository includes 10 Java programs that cover a variety of basic programming topics such as loops, recursion, string manipulation, and more. Each program is well-documented and includes explanations to aid understanding.

## Programs Included

1. **Print Numbers without Loops using Recursion**
   - Recursively prints numbers from 1 to N.
   - Demonstrates the concept of recursion.

2. **Print Number Patterns using Loops**
   - Example Patterns:
     ```
     1
     22
     333
     4444
     ```
     ```
     1
     12
     123
     1234
     ```
   - Uses nested loops to generate patterns.

3. **Reverse a Number using Mathematical Operations**
   - Reverses a given number without using string manipulation methods.

4. **Reverse a String without using Inbuilt Methods**
   - Reverses a given string by iterating from the end.

5. **Factorial of a Number**
   - Computes the factorial of a given number using loops.

6. **String Literals vs String Objects**
   - Explains the difference between string literals and string objects.
   - Demonstrates the use of `.equals()` vs `==` for string comparison.

7. **Missing Closing Indices using Stack**
   - Finds missing closing brackets/parentheses in a string.
   - Uses a stack data structure to track unmatched opening symbols.

8. **Duplicate Values Count in Array using HashMap**
   - Counts duplicate values in an array.
   - Utilizes a HashMap for efficient counting.

9. **Print Number Patterns using Loops and Modulo Operator**
   - Example Pattern:
     ```
     1
     22
     3
     4444
     5
     ```

10. **Reverse a Number using For Loops**
    - Reverses a given number using a for loop.
